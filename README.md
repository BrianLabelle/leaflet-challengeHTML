# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](img/rice-cookers-hw-leaflet.jpg)

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakesfrom the United States Geological Survey GeoJSON Feed page. I then plotted a second data set on my map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. I pulled in a second data set and visualize it along side my original set of data. 
Data on tectonic plates was found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.
